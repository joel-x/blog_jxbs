👋 Hi, I'm Joel, graduated in Mathematical Engineering at the Faculty of Sciences of the National Polytechnic School.

🎓 During my university stage I have acquired the bases to manage risk models, econometric models, statistical models, integer programming models. I have also acquired the basics of actuarial mathematics, mathematical statistics, operations research. In addition, I have been trained in the use of programming languages such as: C++, Matlab, R, Python, and also in the use of statistical packages Statgraphics and Gretl.

📝 The development of my degree work focuses on developing a consumption model based on Friedman's Permanent Income Hypothesis (Novel Economy, 1976) and Modigliani's Life Cycle. 

🎯 My goal is to further develop my skills in statistics, econometrics, actuarial and data science, so I am highly interested in working in these areas.
